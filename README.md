### Hello WorldðŸ‘‹

I'm Vitor Schutz but here on the internet you should know me as PixelNerd, I love programming and solving problems, I'm from Brazil and I'm practically an expert in Game Maker language and I intend to learn more about Python or Java Scripty.

### My workðŸ”§

- I am currently working on my personal project to create a game on GMS and release it on Steam. (You can see My Contributions for this project on my profile)

- I already worked as an "influencer" on Twitch for a year and some months I have some experience in the subject.

### My hobbiesðŸ”­

- I love to watch and monitor the night sky mainly on full moon days (Astronomy would be my career if I didn't love programming so much)

- I love Games & Video Games (I'm a game developer)

- I also like anime and manga is not something I love very much or something I just like and think is cool.

### My Opinion OnlyðŸ’¬

For me, a workplace where people get along and talk and that has some common interests because a good team is a team that knows exactly what others are saying or quoting

### ContactðŸ“«
